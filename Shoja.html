<body><h1>SOJHA</h1>
	With a slow-paced life and breathtaking beauty all around, Shoja is a small village tucked<br/> in sheer scenic vista of Himachal Pradesh. The scenic beauty of Shoja tranquilizes the<br/> soul. The wooden houses and a slow moving life here will be a welcome reprieve from<br/> the busy city life. Pine and Deodar forests coupled with snow covered mountain peaks<br/> stay etched in your memory for long. Located in the Banjar Valley, Shoja is home for many<br/> exquisitely carved wooden temples.

<h2>Places to visit in Shoja</h2> <br/>
<h3>Shoja Waterfall:</h3>Take a morning walk to the Shoja waterfall, which is about a kilometer away and does wonder to your senses. The water is cold and makes a gurgling sound, which is music to the ears. The walk to the fall is blessed with divine beauty!
<h3>Great Himalayan National Park:</h3> Situated in the Kullu region, the Great Himalayan National Park is another place you can visit while in Shoja. It is at a short driving distance from Shoja.
